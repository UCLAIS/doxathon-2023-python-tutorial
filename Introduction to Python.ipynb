    "Python is a popular high-level, dynamically typed, general-purpose programming language that supports a variety of different programming paradigms, including notably object-oriented programming. In particular, Python has been heavily adopted by the machine learning community and is blessed with a large ecosystem of tools and libraries for artificial intelligence and scientific computing more broadly.\n",

    "**This repository contains a collection of resources for beginners to learn the basics of Python in preparation for [DOXATHON 2023](https://doxaai.com/doxathon).**\n",

    "Some content has been adapted from the second tutorial ([Introduction to Python](https://github.com/UCLAIS/ml-tutorials-season-3/blob/main/week-2/1%20-%20Introduction%20to%20Python.ipynb)) of the UCL AI Society Machine Learning Tutorial Series.\n",

This code philosophy continues to influence the design and implementation of Python code today, and it is worth bearing in mind."
